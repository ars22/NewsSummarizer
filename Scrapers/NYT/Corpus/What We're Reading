One 21-year-old admires her for defending "patriotism, sovereignty, French greatness and French history." A young woman yearns for "Frexit" despite her daily commute across the border: "We've never had problems to work in Luxembourg. Why would that change?" - Steven Erlanger, London bureau chief_____From BuzzFeed: In the 1990s, Anna Nicole Smith was a punch line. This thoughtful piece takes her seriously, tracking her emergence from dirt-poor Texas and evolution into a fixture of the celebrity culture, pushed into a kind of myth "whose satisfying conclusion comes not when a woman is exalted, but when she is destroyed." - Erin McCann, senior staff editor, Express_____From Outside: Tumbleweeds - "long immortalized in film and literature as the mascot of the middle of nowhere," according to a highly esteemed colleague - are a nuisance and a hazard. But they're also strangely enchanting. Spend a few minutes with these photographs by Theo Stroomer (who has spent the last three winters documenting the invasion) and you, too, may find yourself under their spell. - Stephen Hiltner, staff editor, Times Insider_____From the National Gallery of Art: The museum's Instagram feed is a quiet invitation to slow down.

A recent post, featuring a 16th-century Italian painting, asked, "How would you describe the relationship between these figures?" - Gina Lamb, deskhead, Projects Desk_____: From The New York Times: In the latest installment of Our Picks, a regular collection of features from around the web, take a break from politics. Read about the man who invented the Frappuccino, the rise and fall of "Twin Peaks" and the delight of subway naps. - Anna Dubenko, senior digital strategist_____
