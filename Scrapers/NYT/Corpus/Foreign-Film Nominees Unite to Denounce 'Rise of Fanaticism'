The directors of all five films nominated for the foreign-language Oscar issued a statement on Friday denouncing the rise of fanaticism and nationalism in the United States and beyond, and criticizing stigmatization based on race, religion, sexuality and gender, which they said bred fear and violence.And, no matter who wins the Oscar, they said, the statuette would be dedicated to activists, journalists, artists and others "working to foster unity and understanding, and who uphold freedom of expression and human dignity - values whose protection is now more important than ever."The directors' statement comes two days before the Academy Awards, and amid tense anticipation that President Trump will soon issue a  revised  travel ban. Last month, the president ordered a halt to visas for travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries, but the order was blocked in court. At the time, one of the filmmakers, Asghar Farhadi, whose drama, "The Salesman," is Iran's nominee, announced that he would not attend the Oscars, in protest of the ban.The statement was signed by Mr. Farhadi along with Martin Zandvliet (director of "Land of Mine," Denmark's nominee), Hannes Holm ("A Man Called Ove," Sweden), Maren Ade ("Toni Erdmann," Germany) and Martin Butler and Bentley Dean ("Tanna," Australia).Their letter lamented that fear-based nationalism had imperiled "the chance to be enriched by something seemingly 'foreign' and the belief that human encounters can change us for the better."The filmmakers said they recognized the limitations of movies, but noted that cinema had the power to soften fear of the other. "We do believe that no other medium can offer such deep insight into other people's circumstances and transform feelings of unfamiliarity into curiosity, empathy and compassion - even for those we have been told are our enemies," the letter said.It was unclear how the letter came about, but a publicist for several of the films said all five filmmakers had been in contact.
